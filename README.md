# Consent Status Website

This Jekyll website displays the current consent status and is designed to be accessed via QR code.

## How it works

- The website shows either "CONSENT GIVEN" or "CONSENT WITHDRAWN" based on the configuration
- The status is controlled by the `consent_status` value in `_config.yml`
- The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch

## Updating the consent status

To change the consent status:

1. Edit the `_config.yml` file
2. Change the `consent_status` value to either:
   - `"given"` - to show consent is given
   - `"withdrawn"` - to show consent is withdrawn
3. Commit and push the changes

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically rebuild and deploy the site. The `last_updated` timestamp will be generated by the runner and passed into the `_config.yml` file.
